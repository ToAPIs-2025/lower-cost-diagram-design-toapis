Pricing checked 2026-10-20. Image examples are dated 2026-10-17; video examples 2026-10-20. Tables sort by example amount or case USD/s. Presets and input modes differ; this is not a matched-settings quality ranking. Unknown-phase image logs are not confirmed final net settlements. Current quotes and historical amounts are separate. Video charges are billing=settled; case USD/s divides charge by actual file duration, never processing time. Token tariffs appear in small text and do not imply a fixed per-second price.

gpt-image-2(VIP) starts at $0.0019/image; this low/1K preset is $0.0019/image. The standalone sampler has 31 historically successful image request templates and 8 video presets. Current-key pricing matches 26 image and 8 video presets; 5 image templates block new paid submission until an exact price is available.

## Tested model types, presets and costs

Updated October 16, 2026. These are tested historical presets/prices; this addition does not relabel the original batch below.

| Model (API ID) | Type | Tested preset | Unit quote | Confirmed unit charge | Count |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| gpt-image-2(VIP) (`gpt-image-2-vip`) | Image | low / 1K / n=1 | $0.0019/image | $0.0019 | 3 |

Confirmed original image/video example subtotal: **$0.0057**.

HTML/SVG is authored separately in code; API PNGs are raster illustrations. No video entry point validated.

gpt-image-2(VIP), **from $0.0019/image**; the tested low/1K preset here is **$0.0019/image**. Different models, qualities and resolutions do not imply equivalent results.

ToAPIs `gpt-image-2-vip / low / 1K / n=1` for Diagram Design workflows. 3 image-2(vip) images: **$0.0057 actually charged**.



Local editable HTML/SVG API diagrams plus independently tested ToAPIs PNG illustrations. PNGs are model outputs; HTML/SVG is authored in code. Agent-host execution was not validated.

## Demo



![API case overview](assets/overview-en.png)



| Case | Original image | Output pixels |

|---|---|---|

| 01-async | [PNG](assets/01-async.png) | 1536 × 864 |

| 02-reference | [PNG](assets/02-reference.png) | 1536 × 864 |

| 03-resume | [PNG](assets/03-resume.png) | 1536 × 864 |



Three [editable HTML/SVG diagrams](diagrams/) are locally authored with no additional model calls. The PNGs above are independent image API outputs; retain their original text quality for comparison.

## Reproduce



Set `TOAPIS_API_KEY` privately in your local environment. Keep it out of source code and chats. Use `TOAPIS_BASE_URL=https://toapis.cn` or `https://toapis.com`.





```bash

# Inspect without paid calls

python scripts/run_demo.py

# Generate the original cases (charged; exact quote checked first)

python scripts/run_demo.py --live --output results

```



The generic script is an external asset runner. Original PPT Master CLI runs are separately identified in the evidence.



## API mapping



```text

Authorization: Bearer TOAPIS_API_KEY

POST /v1/uploads/images             # reference PNG -> HTTPS URL

POST /v1/images/generations         # model,prompt,size,resolution,quality,n,reference_images

GET  /v1/images/generations/{id}    # poll the SAME task

completed -> result.data[0].url -> download PNG without the API key

```



Generation POST is never automatically retried. Preserve .toapis-state or results/private-state to resume the same task. Reference editing is not masked inpainting. Masks, transparency, audio and cloud video were not tested.
